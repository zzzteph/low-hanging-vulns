# CVE-2014-125124

**2025-07-31 15:15:34**

## Description
An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS versions up to and including 5.0RC1 via the Anyterm web interface, which listens on TCP port 8023. The anyterm-module endpoint accepts unsanitized user input via the p parameter and directly injects it into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution as the pandora user. In certain versions (notably 4.1 and 5.0RC1), the pandora user can elevate privileges to root without a password using a chain involving the artica user account. This account is typically installed without a password and is configured to run sudo without authentication. Therefore, full system compromise is possible without any credentials.
