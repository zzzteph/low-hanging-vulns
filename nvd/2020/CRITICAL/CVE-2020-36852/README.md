# CVE-2020-36852

**2025-10-01 07:15:44**

## Description
The Custom Searchable Data Entry System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated database wiping in versions up to, and including 1.7.1, due to a missing capability check and lack of sufficient validation on the ghazale_sds_delete_entries_table_row() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to completely wipe database tables such as wp_users.
