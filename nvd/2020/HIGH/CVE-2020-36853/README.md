**2025-10-18 04:16:02**

## Description
The 10WebMapBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Plugin Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 1.0.63 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and a lack of capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
