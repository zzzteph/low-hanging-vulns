## Description
The Core Config Manager (CCM) in Nagios XI versions prior to CCM 3.0.7 / Nagios XI 5.7.4 contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the object edit pages. Unsanitized user-supplied input was incorporated into SQL queries used by configuration object editors, allowing authenticated users to inject SQL fragments. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized disclosure or modification of configuration and application data, and in some environments could allow further compromise of the application or backend database.
