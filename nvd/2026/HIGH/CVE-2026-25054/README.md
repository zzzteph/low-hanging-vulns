# CVE-2026-25054

**2026-02-04 17:16:23**

## Description
n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 1.123.9 and 2.2.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in a markdown rendering component used in n8n's interface, including workflow sticky notes and other areas that support markdown content. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with a maliciously crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover. This issue has been patched in versions 1.123.9 and 2.2.1.
