# CVE-2026-2001

**2026-02-16 20:19:36**

## Description
The WowRevenue plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check in the 'Notice::install_activate_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
