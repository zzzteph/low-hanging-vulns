## Description
LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions 25.12.0 and below have a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in address-search.inc.php via the address parameter. When a crafted subnet prefix is supplied, the prefix value is concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper parameter binding, allowing an attacker to manipulate query logic and infer database information through time-based conditional responses. This vulnerability requires authentication and is exploitable by any authenticated user. This issue has been fixedd in version 26.2.0.
