# CVE-2026-25051

**2026-02-04 17:16:22**

## Description
n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.123.2, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints. Under certain conditions, the Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection intended to isolate HTML responses may not be applied correctly. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.123.2.
