## Description
Emlog is an open source website building system. In version 2.5.23, article creation functionality is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This can lead to a user being forced to post an article with arbitrary, attacker-controlled content. This, when combined with stored cross-site scripting, leads to account takeover. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.
