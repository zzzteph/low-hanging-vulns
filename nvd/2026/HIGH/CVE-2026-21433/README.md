# CVE-2026-21433

**2026-01-02 19:15:48**

## Description
Emlog is an open source website building system. Versions up to and including 2.5.19 are vulnerable to server-side Out-of-Band (OOB) requests / SSRF via uploaded SVG files. An attacker can upload a crafted SVG to http[:]//emblog/admin/media[.]php which contains external resource references. When the server processes/renders the SVG (thumbnailing, preview, or sanitization), it issues an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled host. Impact: server-side SSRF/OOB leading to internal network probing and potential metadata/credential exposure. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.
