# CVE-2026-23742

**2026-01-16 20:15:51**

## Description
Skipper is an HTTP router and reverse proxy for service composition. The default skipper configuration before 0.23.0 was -lua-sources=inline,file. The problem starts if untrusted users can create lua filters, because of -lua-sources=inline , for example through a Kubernetes Ingress resource. The configuration inline allows these user to create a script that is able to read the filesystem accessible to the skipper process and if the user has access to read the logs, they an read skipper secrets. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.23.0.
