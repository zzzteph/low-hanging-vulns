# CVE-2026-1316

**2026-02-12 13:15:49**

## Description
The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'media[].href' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.97.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers (if 'Enable for Guests' is enabled) to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
