# CVE-2026-25992

**2026-02-10 18:16:38**

## Description
SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Prior to 3.5.5, the /api/file/getFile endpoint uses case-sensitive string equality checks to block access to sensitive files. On case-insensitive file systems such as Windows, attackers can bypass restrictions using mixed-case paths and read protected configuration files. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.5.5.
