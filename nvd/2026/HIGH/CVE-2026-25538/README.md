# CVE-2026-25538

**2026-02-04 22:15:59**

## Description
Devtron is an open source tool integration platform for Kubernetes. In version 2.0.0 and prior, a vulnerability exists in Devtron's Attributes API interface, allowing any authenticated user (including low-privileged CI/CD Developers) to obtain the global API Token signing key by accessing the /orchestrator/attributes?key=apiTokenSecret endpoint. After obtaining the key, attackers can forge JWT tokens for arbitrary user identities offline, thereby gaining complete control over the Devtron platform and laterally moving to the underlying Kubernetes cluster. This issue has been patched via commit d2b0d26.
