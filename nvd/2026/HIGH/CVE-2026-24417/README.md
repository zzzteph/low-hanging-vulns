## Description
OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing. OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the global search functionality. The application fails to properly sanitize the term parameter before using it in SQL LIKE clauses across multiple module-specific search handlers, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through time-based Boolean inference.
