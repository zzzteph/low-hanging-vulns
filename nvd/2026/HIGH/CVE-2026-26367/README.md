# CVE-2026-26367

**2026-02-15 16:15:54**

## Description
eNet SMART HOME server 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 contains a missing authorization vulnerability in the deleteUserAccount JSON-RPC method that permits any authenticated low-privileged user (UG_USER) to delete arbitrary user accounts, except for the built-in admin account. The application does not enforce role-based access control on this function, allowing a standard user to submit a crafted POST request to /jsonrpc/management specifying another username to have that account removed without elevated permissions or additional confirmation.
