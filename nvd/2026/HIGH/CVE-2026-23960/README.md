# CVE-2026-23960

**2026-01-21 22:15:50**

## Description
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Prior to versions 3.6.17 and 3.7.8, stored XSS in the artifact directory listing allows any workflow author to execute arbitrary JavaScript in another user’s browser under the Argo Server origin, enabling API actions with the victim’s privileges. Versions 3.6.17 and 3.7.8 fix the issue.
