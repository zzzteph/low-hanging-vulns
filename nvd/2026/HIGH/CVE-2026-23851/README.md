# CVE-2026-23851

**2026-01-19 20:15:49**

## Description
SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Versions prior to 3.5.4 contain a logic vulnerability in the /api/file/globalCopyFiles endpoint. The function allows authenticated users to copy files from any location on the server's filesystem into the application's workspace without proper path validation. The vulnerability exists in the api/file.go source code. The function globalCopyFiles accepts a list of source paths (srcs) from the JSON request body. While the code checks if the source file exists using filelock.IsExist(src), it fails to validate whether the source path resides within the authorized workspace directory. Version 3.5.4 patches the issue.
