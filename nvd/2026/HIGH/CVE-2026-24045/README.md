# CVE-2026-24045

**2026-02-10 18:16:36**

## Description
Docmost is open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software. From g and before 0.25.0, the public share page functionality in Docmost does not properly HTML-escape page titles before inserting them into meta tags and the title tag. This allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of any user who opens a shared page link. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.25.0.
