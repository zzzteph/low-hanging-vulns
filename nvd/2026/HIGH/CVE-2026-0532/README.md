# CVE-2026-0532

**2026-01-14 11:15:50**

## Description
External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73) combined with Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918) can allow an attacker to cause arbitrary file disclosure through a specially crafted credentials JSON payload in the Google Gemini connector configuration. This requires an attacker to have authenticated access with privileges sufficient to create or modify connectors (Alerts & Connectors: All). The server processes a configuration without proper validation, allowing for arbitrary network requests and for arbitrary file reads.
