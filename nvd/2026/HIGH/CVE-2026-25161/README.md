# CVE-2026-25161

**2026-02-04 20:16:06**

## Description
Alist is a file list program that supports multiple storages, powered by Gin and Solidjs. Prior to version 3.57.0, the application contains path traversal vulnerability in multiple file operation handlers. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level authorisation by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised file removal, movement and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount. This issue has been patched in version 3.57.0.
