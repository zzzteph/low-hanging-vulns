## Description
OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing. OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Error-Based SQL Injection vulnerability in the bulk operations handler for the Scadenzario (Payment Schedule) module. The application fails to validate that elements of the id_records array are integers before using them in an SQL IN() clause, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through XPATH error messages.
