# CVE-2026-24887

**2026-02-03 21:16:13**

## Description
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.72, due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of untrusted commands through the find command. Reliably exploiting this required the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.72.
