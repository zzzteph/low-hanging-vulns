# CVE-2026-26988

**2026-02-20 02:16:54**

## Description
LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions 25.12.0 and below contain an SQL Injection vulnerability in the ajax_table.php endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when processing IPv6 address searches. Specifically, the address parameter is split into an address and a prefix, and the prefix portion is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or database manipulation. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0.
