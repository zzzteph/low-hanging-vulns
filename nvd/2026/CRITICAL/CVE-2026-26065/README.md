# CVE-2026-26065

**2026-02-20 02:16:53**

## Description
calibre is a cross-platform e-book manager for viewing, converting, editing, and cataloging e-books. Versions 9.2.1 and below are vulnerable to Path Traversal through PDB readers (both 132-byte and 202-byte header variants) that allow arbitrary file writes with arbitrary extension and arbitrary content anywhere the user has write permissions. Files are written in 'wb' mode, silently overwriting existing files. This can lead to potential code execution and Denial of Service through file corruption. This issue has been fixed in version 9.3.0.
