**2026-02-12 22:16:06**

## Description
emp3r0r is a stealth-focused C2 designed by Linux users for Linux environments. Prior to 3.21.1, untrusted agent metadata (Transport, Hostname) is accepted during check-in and later interpolated into tmux shell command strings executed via /bin/sh -c. This enables command injection and remote code execution on the operator host. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.21.1.
