# CVE-2026-21877

**2026-01-08 01:15:55**

## Description
n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. In versions 0.121.2 and below, an authenticated attacker may be able to execute malicious code using the n8n service. This could result in full compromise and can impact both self-hosted and n8n Cloud instances. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.3. Administrators can reduce exposure by disabling the Git node and limiting access for untrusted users, but upgrading to the latest version is recommended.
