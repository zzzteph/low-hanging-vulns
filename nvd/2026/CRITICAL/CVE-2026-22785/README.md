# CVE-2026-22785

**2026-01-12 19:16:04**

## Description
orval generates type-safe JS clients (TypeScript) from any valid OpenAPI v3 or Swagger v2 specification. Prior to 7.18.0, the MCP server generation logic relies on string manipulation that incorporates the summary field from the OpenAPI specification without proper validation or escaping. This allows an attacker to "break out" of the string literal and inject arbitrary code. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.18.0.
