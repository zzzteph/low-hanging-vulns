# CVE-2026-25993

**2026-02-10 18:16:38**

## Description
EverShop is a TypeScript-first eCommerce platform. During category update and deletion event handling, the application embeds
path / request_path values—derived from the url_key stored in the database—into SQL statements via string concatenation and passes them to execute(). As a result, if a malicious string is stored in url_key , subsequent event processing modifies and executes the SQL statement, leading to a second-order SQL injection. Patched from v2.1.1.
