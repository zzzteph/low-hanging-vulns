# CVE-2026-24770

**2026-01-27 22:15:56**

## Description
RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In version 0.23.1 and possibly earlier versions, the MinerU parser contains a "Zip Slip" vulnerability, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the server (leading to Remote Code Execution) via a malicious ZIP archive. The MinerUParser class retrieves and extracts ZIP files from an external source (mineru_server_url). The extraction logic in `_extract_zip_no_root` fails to sanitize filenames within the ZIP archive. Commit 64c75d558e4a17a4a48953b4c201526431d8338f contains a patch for the issue.
