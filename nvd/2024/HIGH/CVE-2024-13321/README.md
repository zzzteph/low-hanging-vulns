# CVE-2024-13321

**2025-03-14 08:15:11**

## Description
The AnalyticsWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'custom_sql' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient authorization checks on the handle_get_stats() function.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
