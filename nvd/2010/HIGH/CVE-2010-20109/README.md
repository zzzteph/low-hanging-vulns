# CVE-2010-20109

**2025-08-21 20:15:30**

## Description
Barracuda products, confirmed in Spam & Virus Firewall, SSL VPN, and Web Application Firewall versions prior to October 2010, contain a path traversal vulnerability in the view_help.cgi endpoint. The locale parameter fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject traversal sequences and null-byte terminators to access arbitrary files on the underlying system. By exploiting this flaw, unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve sensitive configuration files such as /mail/snapshot/config.snapshot, potentially exposing credentials, internal settings, and other critical data.
