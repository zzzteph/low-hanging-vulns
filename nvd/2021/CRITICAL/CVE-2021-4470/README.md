## Description
TG8 Firewall contains a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the runphpcmd.php endpoint. The syscmd POST parameter is passed directly to a system command without validation and executed with root privileges. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can supply crafted values to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root, resulting in full device compromise.
