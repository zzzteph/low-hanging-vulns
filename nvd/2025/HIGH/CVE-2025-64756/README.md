# CVE-2025-64756

**2025-11-17 18:15:58**

## Description
Glob matches files using patterns the shell uses. From versions 10.3.7 to 11.0.3, the glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its -c/--cmd option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When glob -c <command> <patterns> are used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with shell: true, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges. This issue has been patched in version 11.1.0.
