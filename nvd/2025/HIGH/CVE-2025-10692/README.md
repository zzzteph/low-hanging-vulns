# CVE-2025-10692

**2025-10-03 21:15:32**

## Description
The endpoint POST /api/staff/get-new-tickets concatenates the user-controlled parameter departmentId directly into the SQL WHERE clause without parameter binding. As a result, an authenticated staff user (level â‰¥ 1) can inject SQL to alter the filter logic, effectively bypassing department scoping and disclosing tickets beyond their intended access.This issue affects OpenSupports: 4.11.0.
