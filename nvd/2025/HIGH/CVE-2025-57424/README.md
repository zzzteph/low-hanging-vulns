## Description
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the MyCourts v3 application within the LTA number profile field. An attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript into their profile, which executes in the browser of any user viewing it, including administrators. Due to the absence of the HttpOnly flag on the session cookie, this flaw could be exploited to capture session tokens and hijack user sessions, enabling elevated access.
