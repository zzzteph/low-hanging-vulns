# CVE-2025-12637

**2025-11-11 04:15:47**

## Description
The Elastic Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a dynamic code generation feature in the process_theme function in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
