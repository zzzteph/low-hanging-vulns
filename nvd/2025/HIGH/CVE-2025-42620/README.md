# CVE-2025-42620

**2025-12-08 13:15:48**

## Description
In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled 
content in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to 
stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).




On the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted 
arbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On 
the frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from 
Markdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string 
templates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could 
create or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript 
payloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of 
any user visiting the affected profile page (user.html). 







This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.
