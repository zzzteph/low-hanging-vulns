**2025-04-16 20:15:17**

## Description
SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the TP-Link TL-WR840N router s login dashboard (version 1.0), allowing an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious SQL statements via the username and password fields. NOTE: this is disputed because the issue can only be reproduced on a supplier-provided emulator, where access control is intentionally absent for ease of functional testing.
