# CVE-2025-9974

**2026-02-02 09:15:54**

## Description
The unified WEBUI application of the ONT/Beacon device contains an input handling flaw that allows authenticated users to trigger unintended system-level command execution. Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data, a low-privileged authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying ONT/Beacon operating system, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.
