## Description
The Cardealer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 due to missing capability check on the 'save_settings' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify the default user role.
