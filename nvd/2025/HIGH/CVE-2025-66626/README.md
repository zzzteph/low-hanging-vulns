# CVE-2025-66626

**2025-12-09 21:16:00**

## Description
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Versions 3.6.13 and below and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.4, contain unsafe untar code that handles symbolic links in archives. Concretely, the computation of a link's target and the subsequent check are flawed. An attacker can overwrite the file /var/run/argo/argoexec with a script of their choice, which would be executed at the pod's start. The patch deployed against CVE-2025-62156 is ineffective against malicious archives containing symbolic links. This issue is fixed in versions 3.6.14 and 3.7.5.
