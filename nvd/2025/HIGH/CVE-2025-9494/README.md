# CVE-2025-9494

**2025-09-23 02:15:47**

## Description
An OS command injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Vitogate 300, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise affected installations. Specifically, the `/cgi-bin/vitogate.cgi` endpoint is affected, when the `form` JSON parameter is set to `form-0-2`. The vulnerability stems from the fact that that function at offset 0x21c24 does not properly sanitize supplied input before interpolating it into a format string which gets passed to `popen()`. Consequently, an authenticated attacker is able to inject arbitrary OS commands and thus gain code execution on affected devices.
