# CVE-2025-64401

**2025-11-12 09:15:40**

## Description
Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links 
to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used "floating frames" linked to external files would 
load the contents of those frames without prompting the user for 
permission to do so.

This issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.

The LibreOffice suite reported this issue as CVE-2023-2255
