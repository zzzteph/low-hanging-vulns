## Description
Stored HTML injection in RISE Ultimate Project Manager & CRM allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML into invoices and messages. Injected content renders in emails, PDFs, and messaging/chat modules sent to clients or team members, enabling phishing, credential theft, and business email compromise. Automated recurring invoices and messaging amplify the risk by distributing malicious content to multiple recipients.
