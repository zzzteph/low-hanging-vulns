# CVE-2025-55161

**2025-08-11 23:15:28**

## Description
Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that performs various operations on PDF files. Prior to version 1.1.0, when using the /api/v1/convert/markdown/pdf endpoint to convert Markdown to PDF, the backend calls a third-party tool to process it and includes a sanitizer for security sanitization which can be bypassed and result in SSRF. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.
