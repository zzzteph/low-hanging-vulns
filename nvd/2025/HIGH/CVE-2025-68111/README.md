## Description
ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `eGive.php` file within the "ReImport" functionality.

This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database. Version 6.5.3 has a patch for the issue.
