# CVE-2025-53002

**2025-06-26 15:15:23**

## Description
LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in LLaMA-Factory versions up to and including 0.9.3 during the LLaMA-Factory training process. This vulnerability arises because the `vhead_file` is loaded without proper safeguards, allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system simply by passing a malicious `Checkpoint path` parameter through the `WebUI` interface. The attack is stealthy, as the victim remains unaware of the exploitation. The root cause is that the `vhead_file` argument is loaded without the secure parameter `weights_only=True`. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.
