**2025-12-18 16:15:57**

## Description
Tina is a headless content management system. In tinacms prior to version 3.1.1, tinacms uses the gray-matter package in an insecure way allowing attackers that can control the content of the processed markdown files, e.g., blog posts, to execute arbitrary code. tinacms version 3.1.1, @tinacms/cli version 2.0.4, and @tinacms/graphql version 2.0.3 contain a fix for the issue.
