**2025-12-18 14:15:59**

## Description
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was discovered in the Reports functionality due to improper validation of an input parameter. An authenticated user with report privileges can define a malicious report containing a JavaScript payload, or a victim can be socially engineered to import a malicious report template. When the victim views or imports the report, the XSS executes in their browser context, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions as the victim, such as modify application data, disrupt application availability, and access limited sensitive information.
