Due to insufficient input validation, SAP Commerce (Swagger UI) allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject the malicious code from remote sources, which can be leveraged by an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This could lead to a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data in SAP Commerce.
