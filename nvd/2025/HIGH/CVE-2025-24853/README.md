# CVE-2025-24853

**2025-07-31 09:15:26**

## Description
A carefully crafted request when creating a header link using the 
wiki markup syntax, which could allow the attacker to execute javascript
 in the victim's browser and get some sensitive information about the 
victim.



Further research by the JSPWiki team showed that the markdown parser allowed this kind of attack too.

Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.12.3 or later.
