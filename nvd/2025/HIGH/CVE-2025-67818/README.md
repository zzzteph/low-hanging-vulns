**2025-12-12 17:15:45**

## Description
An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. An attacker with access to insert data into the database can craft an entry name with an absolute path (e.g., /etc/...) or use parent directory traversal (../../..) to escape the restore root when a backup is restored, potentially creating or overwriting files in arbitrary locations within the application's privilege scope.
