## Description
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to 1.0.93, Due to errors in parsing shell commands related to $IFS and short CLI flags, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code read-only validation and trigger arbitrary code execution. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.93.
