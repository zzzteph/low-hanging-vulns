## Description
The Photos, Files, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Ecommerce Contest Gallery â€“ Upload, Vote, Sell via PayPal or Stripe, Social Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Name and Comment field when commenting on photo gallery entries in all versions up to, and including, 26.0.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
