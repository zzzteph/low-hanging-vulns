## Description
Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2024R2.0.3 contain an incorrect authorization vulnerability that allows non-administrator users to delete global dashboards. The application did not correctly enforce authorization checks for the global dashboard deletion workflow, enabling lower-privileged users to remove dashboards that affect other users or the overall monitoring UI.
