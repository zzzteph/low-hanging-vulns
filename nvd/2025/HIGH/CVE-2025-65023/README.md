# CVE-2025-65023

**2025-11-19 16:15:49**

## Description
i-Educar is free, fully online school management software. In versions 2.10.0 and prior, an authenticated time-based SQL injection vulnerability exists in the ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_cad.php script. An attacker with access to an authenticated session can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the application's database. This vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of the cod_funcionario_vinculo GET parameter, which is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This issue has been patched in commit a00dfa3.
