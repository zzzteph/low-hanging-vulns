# CVE-2025-64336

**2025-11-07 05:16:08**

## Description
ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. In versions 5.5.2-#146 and below, the Manage Photos feature is vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An authenticated regular user can upload a photo with a malicious Photo Title containing HTML/JavaScript code. While the payload does not execute in the user-facing photo gallery or detail pages, it is rendered unsafely in the Admin → Manage Photos section, resulting in JavaScript execution in the administrator’s browser. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.2-#147.
