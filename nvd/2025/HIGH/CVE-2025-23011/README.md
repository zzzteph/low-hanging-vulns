**2025-01-23 21:15:15**

## Description
Fedora Repository 3.8.1 allows path traversal when extracting uploaded archives ("Zip Slip"). A remote, authenticated attacker can upload a specially crafted archive that will extract an arbitrary JSP file to a location that can be executed by an unauthenticated GET request. Fedora Repository 3.8.1 was released on 2015-06-11 and is no longer maintained. Migrate to a currently supported version (6.5.1 as of 2025-01-23).
