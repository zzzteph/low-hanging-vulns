**2025-07-21 21:15:25**

## Description
Cadwyn creates production-ready community-driven modern Stripe-like API versioning in FastAPI. In versions 5.4.3 and below, the version parameter of the "/docs" endpoint is vulnerable to a Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. This XSS would notably allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code on a user's session for any application based on Cadwyn via a one-click attack. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.4.4.
