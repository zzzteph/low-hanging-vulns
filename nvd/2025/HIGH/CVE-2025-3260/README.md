**2025-06-02 10:15:21**

## Description
A security vulnerability in the /apis/dashboard.grafana.app/* endpoints allows authenticated users to bypass dashboard and folder permissions. The vulnerability affects all API versions (v0alpha1, v1alpha1, v2alpha1).

Impact:

- Viewers can view all dashboards/folders regardless of permissions

- Editors can view/edit/delete all dashboards/folders regardless of permissions

- Editors can create dashboards in any folder regardless of permissions

- Anonymous users with viewer/editor roles are similarly affected

Organization isolation boundaries remain intact. The vulnerability only affects dashboard access and does not grant access to datasources.
