## Description
The vulnerability, if exploited, could allow an authenticated miscreant 
(with privilege of "aaConfigTools") to tamper with App Objects' help 
files and persist a cross-site scripting (XSS) injection that when

escalation of privileges. The vulnerability can only be exploited during
 config-time operations within the IDE component of Application Server. 
Run-time components and operations are not affected.
