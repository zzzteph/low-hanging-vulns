# CVE-2025-59536

**2025-10-03 07:15:44**

## Description
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Versions before 1.0.111 were vulnerable to Code Injection due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation. Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.111.
