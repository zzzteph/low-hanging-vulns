# CVE-2025-6990

**2025-11-01 08:15:32**

## Description
The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.0 via the  `TH_PhpCode` pagebuilder widget. This is due to the theme not restricting access to the code editor widget for non-administrators. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
