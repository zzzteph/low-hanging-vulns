# CVE-2025-67648

**2025-12-11 00:16:23**

## Description
Shopware is an open commerce platform. Versions 6.4.6.0 through 6.6.10.9 and 6.7.0.0 through 6.7.5.0 have a Reflected XSS vulnerability in AuthController.php. A request parameter from the login page URL is directly rendered within the Twig template of the Storefront login page without further processing or input validation. This allows direct code injection into the template via the URL parameter, waitTime, which lacks proper input validation. This issue is fixed in versions 6.6.10.10 and 6.7.5.1.
