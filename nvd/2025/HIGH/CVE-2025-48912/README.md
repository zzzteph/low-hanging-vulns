## Description
An authenticated malicious actor using specially crafted requests could bypass row level security configuration by injecting SQL into 'sqlExpression' fields. This allowed the execution of sub-queries to evade parsing defenses ultimately granting unauthorized access to data.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.2, which fixes the issue.
