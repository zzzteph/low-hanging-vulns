**2025-08-18 17:15:31**

## Description
Shaarli is a minimalist bookmark manager and link sharing service. Prior to 0.15.0, the input string in the cloud tag page is not properly sanitized. This allows the </title> tag to be prematurely closed, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.15.0.
