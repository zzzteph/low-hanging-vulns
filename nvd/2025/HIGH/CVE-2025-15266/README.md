## Description
The GeekyBot — Generate AI Content Without Prompt, Chatbot and Lead Generation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the chat message field in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the Chat History page.
