# CVE-2025-59332

**2025-09-15 20:15:39**

## Description
3DAlloy is a lightWeight 3D-viewer for MediaWiki. From 1.0 through 1.8, the <3d> parser tag and the {{#3d}} parser function allow users to provide custom attributes that are then appended to the canvas HTML element that is being output by the extension. The attributes are not sanitized, which means that arbitrary JavaScript can be inserted and executed.
