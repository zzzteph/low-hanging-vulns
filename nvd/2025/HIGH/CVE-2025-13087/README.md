**2025-11-20 22:15:54**

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the Opto22 Groov Manage REST API on GRV-EPIC and groov RIO Products that allows remote code execution with root privileges. When a POST request is executed against the vulnerable endpoint, the application reads certain header details and unsafely uses these values to build commands, allowing an attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary commands that execute as root.
