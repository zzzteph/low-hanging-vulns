**2025-10-17 02:15:52**

## Description
An Incorrect Authorization vulnerability has been identified in Moxaâ€™s network security appliances and routers. A flaw in the API authentication mechanism allows unauthorized access to protected API endpoints, including those intended for administrative functions. This vulnerability can be exploited after a legitimate user has logged in, as the system fails to properly validate session context or privilege boundaries. An attacker may leverage this flaw to perform unauthorized privileged operations. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality or integrity within any subsequent systems.
