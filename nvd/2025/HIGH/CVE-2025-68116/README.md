# CVE-2025-68116

**2025-12-16 17:16:11**

## Description
FileRise is a self-hosted web file manager / WebDAV server. Versions prior to 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsafe handling of browser-renderable user uploads when served through the sharing and download endpoints. An attacker who can get a crafted SVG (primary) or HTML (secondary) file stored in a FileRise instance can cause JavaScript execution when a victim opens a generated share link (and in some cases via the direct download endpoint). This impacts share links (`/api/file/share.php`) and direct file access / download path (`/api/file/download.php`), depending on browser/content-type behavior. Version 2.7.1 fixes the issue.
