# CVE-2025-5117

**2025-05-27 12:15:36**

## Description
The Property plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the use of the property_package_user_role metadata in versions 1.0.5 to 1.0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author‚Äêlevel access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator by creating a package post whose property_package_user_role is set to administrator and then submitting the PayPal registration form.
