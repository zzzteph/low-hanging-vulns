**2025-08-05 07:15:34**

## Description
The Use-your-Drive | Google Drive plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'title' parameter in file metadata in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability can be exploited by the lowest authentication level permitted to upload files, including unauthenticated users, once a file upload shortcode is published on a publicly accessible post.
