## Description
Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system (CMS). Versions 4.3.0 and below contain a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the CMS Developer menu's Module Templating functionality, allowing authenticated users with "System -> Add/Edit custom modules and templates" permissions to manipulate Twig filters and execute arbitrary server-side functions as the web server user. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.1. To workaround this issue, use the 4.1 and 4.2 patch commits.
