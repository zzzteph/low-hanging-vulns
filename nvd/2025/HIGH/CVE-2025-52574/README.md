**2025-06-24 03:15:34**

## Description
SysmonElixir is a system monitor HTTP service in Elixir. Prior to version 1.0.1, the /read endpoint reads any file from the server's /etc/passwd by default. In v1.0.1, a whitelist was added that limits reading to only files under priv/data. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.1.
