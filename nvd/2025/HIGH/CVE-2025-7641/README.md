# CVE-2025-7641

**2025-08-15 09:15:27**

## Description
The Assistant for NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary directory deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the /wp-json/nextgenassistant/v1.0.0/control REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary directories on the server, which can cause a complete loss of availability.
