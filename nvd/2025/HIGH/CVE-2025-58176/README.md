# CVE-2025-58176

**2025-09-03 04:16:02**

## Description
Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victimâ€™s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.
