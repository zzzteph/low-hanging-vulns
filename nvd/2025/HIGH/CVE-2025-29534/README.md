## Description
An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in PowerStick Wave Dual-Band Wifi Extender V1.0 allows an attacker with valid credentials to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The issue stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the /cgi-bin/cgi_vista.cgi executable, which is passed to a system-level function call.
