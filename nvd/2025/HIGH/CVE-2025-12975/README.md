## Description
The CTX Feed – WooCommerce Product Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the woo_feed_plugin_installing() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
