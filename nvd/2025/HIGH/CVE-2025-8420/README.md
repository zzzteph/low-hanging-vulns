**2025-08-06 03:15:27**

## Description
The Request a Quote Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in version less than, or equal to, 2.5.2 via the emd_form_builder_lite_pagenum function. This is due to the plugin not properly validating user input before using it as a function name. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server, however, parameters can not be passed to the functions called.
