## Description
The Quantenna Wi-Fi chipset ships with a local control script, router_command.sh (in the put_file_to_qtn argument), that is vulnerable to command injection. This is an instance of CWE-88, "Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')," and is estimated as a CVSS 7.7 ( CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) .
This issue affects Quantenna Wi-Fi chipset through version 8.0.0.28 of the latest SDK, and appears to be unpatched at the time of this CVE record's first publishing, though the vendor has released a best practices guide for implementors of this chipset.
