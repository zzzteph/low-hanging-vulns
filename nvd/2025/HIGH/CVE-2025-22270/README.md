# CVE-2025-22270

**2025-02-28 13:15:27**

## Description
An attacker with access to the Administration panel, specifically the "Role Management"
tab, can
inject code by adding a new role in the "name" field. It should be noted, however, that the risk of exploiting vulnerability is reduced due to the
required additional error that allows bypassing the Content-Security-Policy policy, which
mitigates JS code execution while still allowing HTML injection.


This issue affects CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager in SaaS version 24.7.1. The status of other versions is unknown. After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer.
