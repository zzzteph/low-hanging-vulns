# CVE-2025-54800

**2025-08-12 16:15:28**

## Description
Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.
