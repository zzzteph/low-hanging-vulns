# CVE-2025-6190

**2025-07-23 03:15:24**

## Description
The Realty Portal â€“ Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within the rp_user_profile() AJAX handler in versions 0.1.0 through 0.3.9. The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role.
