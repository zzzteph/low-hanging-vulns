# CVE-2025-55200

**2025-10-09 19:15:43**

## Description
BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions prior to 3.0.13, the "Shared Notes" feature contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with the input location being the "Username" field and the output location on the "Shared Notes" page, when a user with a malicious username is editing content. This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of higher-privileged users (e.g., Admins) who open the Shared Notes page. Version 3.0.13 fixes the issue.
