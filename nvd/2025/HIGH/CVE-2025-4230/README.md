## Description
A command injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables an authenticated administrator to bypass system restrictions and run arbitrary commands as a root user. To be able to exploit this issue, the user must have access to the PAN-OS CLI.

The security risk posed by this issue is significantly minimized when CLI access is restricted to a limited group of administrators. 

Cloud NGFW and Prisma® Access are not affected by this vulnerability.
