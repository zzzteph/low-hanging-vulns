# CVE-2025-65099

**2025-11-19 18:15:51**

## Description
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 1.0.39, when running on a machine with Yarn 3.0 or above, Claude Code could have been tricked to execute code contained in a project via yarn plugins before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this would have required a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory and to be using Yarn 3.0 or above. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.39.
