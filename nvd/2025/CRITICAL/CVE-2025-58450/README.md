## Description
pREST (PostgreSQL REST), is an API that delivers an application on top of a Postgres database. SQL injection is possible in versions prior to 2.0.0-rc3. The validation present in versions prior to 2.0.0-rc3 does not provide adequate protection from injection attempts. Version 2.0.0-rc3 contains a patch to mitigate such attempts.
