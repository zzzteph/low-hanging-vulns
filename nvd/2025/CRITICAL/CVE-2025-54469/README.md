# CVE-2025-54469

**2025-10-30 10:15:34**

## Description
A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.


The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor
 process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks 
whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the 
monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.


The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT
 are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without 
validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user 
to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer
 container.
