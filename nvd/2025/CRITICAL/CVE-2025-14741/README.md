The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization to unauthorized data modification and deletion due to a missing capability check on the 'delete_object' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.25. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts, pages, products, taxonomy terms, and user accounts.
