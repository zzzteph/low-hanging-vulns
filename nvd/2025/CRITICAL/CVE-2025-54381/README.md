# CVE-2025-54381

**2025-07-29 23:15:32**

## Description
BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference. In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default. Version 1.4.19 contains a patch for the issue.
