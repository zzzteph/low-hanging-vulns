## Description
A Path Traversal vulnerability in the Allsky WebUI version v2024.12.06_06 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution. By sending a crafted HTTP request to the /html/execute.php endpoint with a malicious payload in the id parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, leading to full remote code execution (RCE).
