# CVE-2025-11539

**2025-10-09 08:15:38**

## Description
Grafana Image Renderer is vulnerable to remote code execution due to anÂ arbitrary file write vulnerability. This is due to the fact that the /render/csv endpoint lacked validation of the filePath parameter that allowed an attacker to save a shared object to an arbitrary location that is then loaded by the Chromium process.

Instances are vulnerable if:

1. The default token ("authToken") is not changed, or is known to the attacker.
2. The attacker can reach the image renderer endpoint.
This issue affects grafana-image-renderer: from 1.0.0 through 4.0.16.
