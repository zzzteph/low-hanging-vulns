# CVE-2025-8723

**2025-08-19 08:15:30**

## Description
The Cloudflare Image Resizing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to missing authentication and insufficient sanitization within its hook_rest_pre_dispatch() method in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP into the codebase, achieving remote code execution.
