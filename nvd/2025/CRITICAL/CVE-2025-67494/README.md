# CVE-2025-67494

**2025-12-09 22:16:16**

## Description
ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. Versions 4.7.0 and below are vulnerable to an unauthenticated, full-read SSRF vulnerability. The ZITADEL Login UI (V2) treats the x-zitadel-forward-host header as a trusted fallback for all deployments, including self-hosted instances. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary domains, such as internal addresses, and read the responses, enabling data exfiltration and bypassing network-segmentation controls. This issue is fixed in version 4.7.1.
