# CVE-2025-64128

**2025-11-26 18:15:49**

An OS command injection vulnerability exists due to incomplete 
validation of user-supplied input. Validation fails to enforce 
sufficient formatting rules, which could permit attackers to append 
arbitrary data. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject 
arbitrary commands.
