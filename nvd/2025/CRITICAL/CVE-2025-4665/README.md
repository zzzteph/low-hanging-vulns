# CVE-2025-4665

**2025-10-29 00:15:34**

## Description
WordPress plugin Contact Form CFDB7 versions up to and including 1.3.2 are affected by a pre-authentication SQL injection vulnerability that cascades into insecure deserialization (PHP Object Injection). The weakness arises due to insufficient validation of user input in plugin endpoints, allowing crafted input to influence backend queries in unexpected ways. Using specially crafted payloads, this can escalate into unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary object injection in PHP. Although the issue is remotely exploitable without authentication, it does require a crafted interaction with the affected endpoint in order to trigger successfully.
