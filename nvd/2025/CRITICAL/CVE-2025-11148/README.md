# CVE-2025-11148

**2025-09-30 11:37:38**

## Description
All versions of the package check-branches are vulnerable to Command Injection check-branches is a command-line tool that is interacted with locally, or via CI, to confirm no conflicts exist in git branches.However, the library follows these conventions which can be abused:1. It trusts branch names as they are (plain text)2. It spawns git commands by concatenating user inputSince a branch name is potentially a user input - as users can create branches remotely via pull requests, or simply due to privileged access to a repository - it can effectively be abused to run any command.
