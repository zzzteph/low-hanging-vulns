# CVE-2025-14344

**2025-12-12 04:15:49**

## Description
The Multi Uploader for Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'plupload_ajax_delete_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server.
