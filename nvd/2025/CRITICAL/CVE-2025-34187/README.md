## Description
Ilevia EVE X1/X5 Server version â‰¤ 4.7.18.0.eden contains a misconfiguration in the sudoers file that allows passwordless execution of certain Bash scripts. If these scripts are writable by web-facing users or accessible via command injection, attackers can replace them with malicious payloads. Execution with sudo grants full root access, resulting in remote privilege escalation and potential system compromise.
