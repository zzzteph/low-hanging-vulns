# CVE-2025-64419

**2026-01-05 20:16:02**

## Description
Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.445, parameters coming from docker-compose.yaml are not sanitized when used in commands. If a victim user creates an application from an attacker repository (using build pack "docker compose"), the attacker can execute commands on the Coolify instance as root. Version 4.0.0-beta.445 fixes the issue.
