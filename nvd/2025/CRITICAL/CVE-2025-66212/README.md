# CVE-2025-66212

**2025-12-23 22:15:52**

## Description
Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Dynamic Proxy Configuration Filename handling allows users with application/service management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. Proxy configuration filenames are passed to shell commands without proper escaping, enabling full remote code execution. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.
