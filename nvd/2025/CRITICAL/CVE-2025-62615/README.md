**2026-02-04 23:15:55**

## Description
AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.34, in RSSFeedBlock, the third-party library urllib.request.urlopen is used directly to access the URL, but the input URL is not filtered, which will cause SSRF vulnerability. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.34.
