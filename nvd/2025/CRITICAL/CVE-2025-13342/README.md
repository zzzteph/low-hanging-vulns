# CVE-2025-13342

**2025-12-03 13:16:02**

## Description
The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of arbitrary WordPress options in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.20. This is due to insufficient capability checks and input validation in the ActionOptions::run() save handler. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify critical WordPress options such as users_can_register, default_role, and admin_email via submitting crafted form data to public frontend forms.
