# CVE-2025-3499

**2025-07-09 09:15:27**

## Description
The device has two web servers that expose unauthenticated REST APIs on the management network (TCP
ports 8084 and 8086). Exploiting OS command injection through these APIs, an attacker can send arbitrary
commands that are executed with administrative permissions by the underlying operating system.
