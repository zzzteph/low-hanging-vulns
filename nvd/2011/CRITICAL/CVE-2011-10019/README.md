**2025-08-13 21:15:29**

## Description
Spreecommerce versions prior to 0.60.2 contains a remote command execution vulnerability in its search functionality. The application fails to properly sanitize input passed via the search[send][] parameter, which is dynamically invoked using Rubyâ€™s send method. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server without authentication.
