# CVE-2011-10011

**2025-08-13 21:15:28**

## Description
WeBid 1.0.2 contains a remote code injection vulnerability in the converter.php script, where unsanitized input in the to parameter of a POST request is written directly into includes/currencies.php. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code, resulting in persistent remote code execution when the modified script is accessed or included by the application.
