**2025-08-13 21:15:27**

## Description
S40 CMS v0.4.2 contains a path traversal vulnerability in its index.php page handler. The p parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to traverse the file system and access arbitrary files outside the web root. This can be exploited remotely without authentication by appending traversal sequences and a null byte to bypass file extension checks.
