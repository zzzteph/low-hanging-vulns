# CVE-2009-10005

**2025-08-20 16:15:32**

## Description
ContentKeeper Web Appliance (now maintained by Impero Software) versions prior to 125.10 expose the mimencode binary via a CGI endpoint, allowing unauthenticated attackers to retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem. By crafting a POST request to /cgi-bin/ck/mimencode with traversal and output parameters, attackers can read sensitive files such as /etc/passwd outside the webroot.
